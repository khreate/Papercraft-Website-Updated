						<p>Khreator here with another update. I've created a prototype for online turn submission that I will be testing over the next few days. If it's up to par, we will use it for the next official game. Finally, this site will have some use other than just being a wiki. I have also begun research on creating an interactive map with stats on your character including health, inventory, and position, so look forward to that in the coming months. Unfortunately, senior year will be busier for me than any year before it, so changes will be coming out slower when the year starts. Please remember to check out our Discord server and ask questions/make suggestions. Have a wonderful rest of the summer!

						<p>I've migrated the website over to Bootstrap, now I'll be updating UI using Bootstrap classes when I get the chance to do so. Our website is now the <strong>first</strong> result on Google (and other search engines) if the query is "Papercrafted Adventures." Thanks for bearing with me as I make these changes, I'll try to be done with them as soon as possible. Also, give us feedback on and suggestions for our website through our Discord server: https://discord.gg/QUfyz97

							Yo! Khreator here. I've been slowly and silently updating the website. Please don't be scared of any sudden changes that occur (Scarce). I am currently in the process of migrating our CSS to Bootstrap, so our website will look really good. Also, our website is now searchable on Google! Just search "Papercrafted Adventures", and this site will be within the top 5 results<sup>I'm working on this</sup>. Anyways, have a nice summer, everyone!

							Okay, I'm making another one of these. Now that Khreator has become active and acquired an FTP account, I've relucatantly resumed development of this site (with Khreator). I've been inactive because of <em>things</em>, of course. The Skype game is continuing, albeit slowly because some people just can't seem to get their turns in on time. I'm writing turn 45 right now, so unless everyone dies really fast you'll get at least 150 turns in the future. For the purpose of being consistent with naming files:
							<ul>
								<li>Grandmaster Poo <!-- thepoopmaster --> is Player 1</li>
								<li>Trexrush <!-- stuuuupid -->is Player 2</li>
								<li>Khreator <!-- the GOD --> is Player 4</li>
							</ul>
							Who am I? I'm Player 0, of course! Which other number would I use?

							Hey guys, this is Scarce here testing out my website making skills. Not much yet, but I have a somewhat functional layout! I can't decide if I should go by Scarce or IO, short for Impossible Organism. IO also stands for Input/Output. Also I added a copyright for shits n' giggles.
