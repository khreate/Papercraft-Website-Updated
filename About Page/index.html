				<h2>About</h2>
				<h3>Papercrafted Adventures V0.1</h3>
				<p>-The Papercrafted Team<br />Scarce (IO), Grandmaster Poo, Khreator, Pluto, and Trexrush.</p>
				<p>
				 	Heya, Scarce here.<br />
					Papercrafted Aventures is a game that my friends and I made a couple years ago. Here are the rules. Enjoy.
				</p>
				<h2>Rules</h2>
				<h3>General Rules</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						A game is played with a host and at least 2 players.
						<ul><li>The host can be a player; it is up to the player’s choice.</li></ul>
					</li>
					<li>A map is drawn.</li>
					<li>
						Each player decides on a symbol.
						<ul><li>The location of the symbol on the map corresponds to the location of the player.</li></ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Each player has an inventory and a stat menu.
						<ul><li>All players are conscious by necessity at the start of the game.</li></ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Mods can be added to the game, but they should be consistent and used for the entirety of the game.
						<ul>
							<li>An example of a mod is a scale for describing the importance of wounds.</li>
							<li>This includes modifications to the rules to account for a different game medium.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Each player inputs their turn and gets one roll per turn. The roll decides their success at the action described in their turn.
						<ul><li>Turns happen simultaneously, so all of the rolls and inputs must be in before deciding on an effect if necessary. See 1.2, 1.3</li></ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						The host describes what happens and modifies the state of the game based on the current game, roll, and input.
						<ul><li>It’s okay for a player to ask a host to clarify something, unless otherwise specified.</li></ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						The last player (or team) to have their consciousness destroyed wins.
						<ul><li>A sleeping player or KOd player can win, but a killed one cannot. If conscious is recovered, a player can not regain their ability to win.</li></ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			
				<h3>Rolling</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Use an eraser with angled edges.
						<ul><li>&quot;Pink Eraser, Erases Clean and Clear&quot;</li></ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						The largest sides are considered &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down.&quot;
						<ul><li>The marked side is considered up by convention.</li></ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						The thinner sides are considered &quot;good side&quot; and &quot;bad side.&quot;
						<ul>
							<li>If the eraser lands on these at any time during rolling, the roll counts as the corresponding side.</li>
							<li>If it lands on more than one good or bad side, good sides trump.</li>
							<li>It would be <strong>really cool</strong> to get more than one good side a roll.<span style="font-size: 1px;">Sand staffs are realy cool :A -Scarce (IO)</span></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>If you don't have a standard eraser, adjust the value of a side based on the thickness of the eraser.</li>
					<li>The game is biased towards success in order to promote the propagation of shenanigans.</li>
					<li>If the first roll is DOWN, the value is 3. If the first roll is UP, the value is 4. In the subsequent 2 rolls, add or subtract one when you roll an UP or DOWN, respectively. This is the final value.
					</li>
					<p>Here's a table:</p>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<th>Roll</th>
							<th>Value</th>
						<tr>
						<tr>
							<td>DOWN, DOWN, DOWN</td>
							<td>1</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>UP, DOWN, DOWN</td>
							<td>2</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>DOWN, UP, DOWN</td>
							<td>3</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>DOWN, DOWN, UP</td>
							<td>3</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>UP, UP, DOWN</td>
							<td>4</td>
						</tr><tr>
							<td>UP, DOWN, UP</td>
							<td>4</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>DOWN, UP, UP</td>
							<td>5</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>UP, UP, UP</td>
							<td>6</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</ul>
				<h3>Roll Values</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>&quot;Bad side&quot; is the worst roll, often severely damaging the player who rolls it. It doesn’t often kill, but hurts like hell.</li>
					<li>1 is the worst normal roll. Like a bad side, but less severe, and can often be recovered from with a better roll on the next turn</li>
					<li>2 is normally a minor inconvenience that doesn’t do much to the player who rolls it. It can be damaging if the player is doing something very important.</li>
					<li>3 is completely neutral. Rolling a 3 can accomplish basic tasks like walking and other stuff like pooping.</li>
					<li>4 is slightly positive. A bit of good luck, like finding a lucky penny, but more useful.</li>
					<li>5 is good. It won’t make player god, but often tasks will be completed well.</li>
					<li>6 is very lucky. It can get someone a much greater reward for a turn than other rolls. Multiple 6s can go a long way</li>
					<li>
						&quot;Good side&quot; is the best roll. Getting one can get a player damn near anything, from an epic sword to full healing to a rod that controls sand in the middle of a freaking desert.
						<ul><li>They make the game memorable.</li></ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				
						
				<h3>Team Rules</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						There can be more than one winner if players form a team and survive.
						<ul>
							<li>In order to join or create a team, members must participate in some form of in-game communication.</li>
							<li>A player cannot win by losing but being on a winning team.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>An NPC ally can not win the game for a lost player, even if the player can still control them.</li>
					<li>If all the remaining players die in the same turn, it is a tie between those players. A player must last a turn greater than other players in order to win.</li>
				</ul>
