<h3>Shop Mod</h3>  
<hr>
<section><p>The Shop Mod is a modification that allows a universal player-accessible shop with items that can vary throughout the game at the whim of the game-maker.</p></section>
<article><p>Here's an arbitrary list that may constitute a shop.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Sword : 30G</li>
  <li>Health Potion : 20G</li>
  <li>Grandmaster's Poop: 50000G</li>
</ul>
</article>
<section><p>Note: This mod is <em>extremely</em> flexible, so I can't really elaborate more on this. Oh, and the shop can be used by any player at any time, unless you're playing with the <a href="hrealmod.html">Hyper-Realism mod</a> active.</p></section>
