			<h3>Power Mod</h3>
			<hr>
			<section>
				<p>
					The power mod allows for the creation of a character which has a special ability chosen by the owner of the character. In order to be balanced, this mod should have the requirement of setting an ability and a qualifier. For example, Khreator's power is to double high rolls - the 4, 5, and 6 rolls are doubled. However, it has the caveat that the 1 and 2 rolls <em>turn negative and are doubled</em>. Another example is IO's power, which allows him to make a rule that affects the game for the entirety of play. In order to balance this, we created the caveat that it would involve a physical keyboard appearing in the hands of his character which could be stolen and used to reverse the changes. Of course, with something like that, we had to create a few more rules: there cannot be duplicate powers in play, and no power can be used to do something that the GM deems to be insanely overpowered.
