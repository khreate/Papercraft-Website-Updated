<h3>Tournament Mod</h3>
<hr>
<section>For returning Papercrafted members (original crew), you'll remember this! We had little arenas on index cards and everything!:)</section>
<article><p>This mod is meant for playing with many participants and allows for mass management, leaderboards, integration with shop, blood mods (sub-mod of the <a href="hrealmod.html" target=_blank>Hyper-Realism mod</a>), etc.</p>
<p>Tournaments can be any style:
  <ul>
    <li>Round Robin</li>
      <ul>
        <li>An even number of players or teams participates. Every player/team plays against each other; each win counts as one point. The player/team with the most points at the end of the tournament wins. (Note: One less game is played than the number of participating players/teams [<strong>n</strong> participants, <strong>n-1</strong> games played])</li>
      </ul>    
    <li>Ladder</li>
      <ul>
        <li>A "season" of competitive play occurs, with either single player or team participants. This "season" goes on for a period of time, and at the end of the period, the participant(s) with the most points wins.</li>
      </ul>    
    <li>King of the Hill</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Competitive play may occur with individual players, teams, or both. In the first match, two players/teams face off. The winner earns the status of "King", and each subsequent match <strong>must</strong> be played against him/her/them. (Note: This tournament may go on for any amount of time you choose to play it; however, it is popular to set a cap for the number of wins a "King" must accumulate to win the tournament.)</li>
    </ul>    
    <li>Elimination</li>
      <ul>
        <li>A bracket is formed randomly with the participants. Teams get eliminated as they are cut from the bracket. The winner of this tournament is the participant that makes it to the end of the bracket without losing. (Note: Creation of a loser's bracket is allowed and encouraged for those who would like to include everyone in official tournaments)
      </ul>
  </ul>
<p>Note that any of these styles can be played with teams, if so desired. However, certain tournament styles restrict the number of participants.</p>
